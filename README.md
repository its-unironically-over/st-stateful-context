# Stateful Context

Enables prompts with custom state to decide what they add to the context. The AI is given actions which can be invoked during generations to change the state.

An example would be a chatbot about driving a car, and you have a prompt with a basic counter keeping track of fuel. When you drive somewhere, the AI will know from the prompt to invoke an action that lowers the fuel stat. If you're out of fuel, you can change what the prompt adds to the context. Maybe if you try driving somewhere with low fuel, the context changes to include a mention of running on fumes. Without fuel, the context changes to reject any driving commands.
